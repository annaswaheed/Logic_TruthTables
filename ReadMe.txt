Logic Truth Tables

I was required for my discrete maths class to write a program which takes input from the user 
and create a logical truth tables for AND OR NOT & Implies function.

It solves the problem of manually creating the truth tables.

while creating this project i improved more my concepts of flow of control while using multiple 
nest for loops.

features.
* it can take upto 4 variables as input and as low as 1 variable input.
* user can select AND, OR, NOT, implies (p->q) truth tables
 
this program is written in c++ and can be complied on any c++ ide such as visual studio


the whole source code is written by myself (Siddi Annas Waheed)
